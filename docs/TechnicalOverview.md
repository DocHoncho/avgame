# AVGame - Technical Overview

## Core Tech Stack
- **TypeScript** - Primary language
- **Vite** - Build system and dev server with hot reloading
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics engine
- **Vue** - UI/HUD system (native Vite integration)

## Engine Architecture

### Core Systems

#### Renderer
- Three.js based 3D renderer
- Fixed 3/4 isometric view with optional rotation
- Tron-inspired visual style:
  - Edge highlighting/glow effects
  - Emission maps for energy/corruption visualization
  - Shader system for special effects (corruption spread, energy pulses)
- Efficient tile-based rendering:
  - Geometry instancing for repeated elements
  - Frustum culling
  - Merged geometry for static elements
  - Level-of-detail system for distant tiles

#### Input System
- WASD movement
- Mouse aim/targeting
- Key binding system for abilities
- UI input handling (menus, inventory)
- Controller support consideration

#### State Management
- Game State Machine:
  ```
  MainMenu
    └─ GameSession
         ├─ Playing
         ├─ Paused
         ├─ Inventory
         └─ Map
    └─ LevelEditor
    └─ Settings
  ```
- State persistence system
- Save/Load functionality

#### UI Framework
- Vue-based UI system
- Composable components for:
  - HUD elements (health, energy, status effects)
  - Inventory screens
  - Skill trees
  - Equipment modification
  - Status/buff displays
  - Tooltips
- UI state management (Pinia)

### Game Systems

#### Grid System
- Tile-based world representation
- Pathfinding (A*)
- Line of sight calculations
- Collision detection
- Tile property system (walkable, corrupted, etc.)

#### Entity Component System (ECS)
Components needed for:
- Physical properties (position, rotation)
- Combat stats (integrity, firewall, energy)
- Status effects
- AI behaviors
- Projectile properties
- Collision
- Visual effects

#### Combat System
- Projectile management
- Hitbox detection
- Damage calculation
- Status effect application
- Heat/energy management
- Ability cooldowns

#### Particle System
- Projectile trails
- Impact effects
- Status indicators
- Environmental effects (corruption spread)
- Energy/power visualizations

#### Audio System
- Sound effect management
- Music system
- Dynamic mixing based on game state
- Positional audio for effects

### Data Management

#### Asset Loading
- Model loading
- Texture management
- Sound loading
- Level data
- Progressive loading for large maps

#### Save System
- Character progression
- Equipment loadouts
- Level state
- Settings

### Development Tools

#### Debug Tools
- FPS counter
- Performance metrics
- Hit box visualization
- Path visualization
- State inspector

#### Level Editor
- Tile placement
- Entity placement
- Property editing
- Test mode
- Import/Export functionality

## Performance Considerations

### Rendering Optimization
- Instanced rendering for repeated elements
- Occlusion culling
- Texture atlasing
- Shader optimization
- Batch rendering for particles

### Memory Management
- Asset pooling
- Entity pooling
- Garbage collection optimization
- Memory usage monitoring

### Network Considerations
- Potential future multiplayer support
- Client/Server architecture planning
- State synchronization design

## Build and Deploy
- Vite configuration
- Asset bundling
- Production optimization
- Cross-platform considerations

## Testing Framework
- Unit testing setup
- Integration testing
- Performance testing
- Automated UI testing

## Next Steps
1. Set up basic project structure
2. Implement core rendering pipeline
3. Create basic movement and control system
4. Establish UI framework
5. Develop initial game state management
