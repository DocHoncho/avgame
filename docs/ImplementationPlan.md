# AVGame - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased approach for implementing the game engine and core systems, with a focus on getting a basic test environment running first.

## Phase 1: Core Engine Foundation
Goal: Basic rendering and game loop setup to enable visual testing.

### Steps
1. Project Setup
   - Initialize Vite + TypeScript + Vue project
   - Set up basic project structure
   - Configure build system
   - Establish coding standards and linting

2. Basic Renderer
   - Three.js integration
   - Basic 3/4 isometric camera setup
   - Test grid rendering
   - Window resize handling
   - Basic performance monitoring

3. Game Loop
   - Main loop structure
   - Time delta handling
   - Basic state machine
   - Debug overlay (FPS, etc.)

## Phase 2: Input and Movement
Goal: Basic player control system to test movement and camera behavior.

### Steps
1. Input System
   - WASD movement handling
   - Mouse position tracking
   - Input state management
   - Key binding system foundation

2. Agent Implementation
   - Basic agent mesh/model
   - Movement mechanics
   - Collision detection foundation
   - Camera following behavior

3. Test Environment
   - Simple test level
   - Movement boundary system
   - Debug visualization tools

## Phase 3: Grid System and Rendering Optimization
Goal: Efficient tile-based world representation with proper culling and instancing.

### Steps
1. Grid System
   - Tile data structure
   - Grid coordinate system
   - Basic pathfinding (A*)
   - Tile property system

2. Rendering Optimization
   - Geometry instancing
   - Frustum culling
   - Merged geometry for static elements
   - Level of detail system

3. Visual Style Foundation
   - Edge highlighting shader
   - Basic glow effects
   - Material system for Tron-like aesthetics

## Phase 4: UI Framework
Goal: Establish the foundation for game UI and HUD elements.

### Steps
1. Vue Integration
   - Component architecture
   - State management setup (Pinia)
   - UI layer management

2. Basic HUD
   - Health/Integrity display
   - Energy meter
   - Status effects area
   - Debug overlay improvements

3. Menu System
   - Pause menu
   - Basic inventory screen
   - Settings interface

## Phase 5: Game Systems Integration
Goal: Begin implementing core game mechanics and systems.

### Steps
1. Combat Foundation
   - Basic projectile system
   - Hit detection
   - Damage calculation
   - Visual feedback

2. Entity Component System
   - Core ECS architecture
   - Basic component types
   - Entity management
   - Component relationships

3. Effects System
   - Particle system
   - Visual effects manager
   - Basic shader effects
   - Audio system foundation

## Phase 6: Development Tools
Goal: Create tools necessary for content creation and debugging.

### Steps
1. Debug Tools
   - Entity inspector
   - Performance profiler
   - State debugger
   - Grid visualizer

2. Level Editor Foundation
   - Basic tile placement
   - Entity placement
   - Property editor
   - Save/Load functionality

## Testing Strategy
Each phase should include:
- Unit tests for core systems
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Performance benchmarks
- Playtesting scenarios

## Success Criteria
Each phase should meet these criteria before moving to the next:
- All core features functional
- Performance meets target metrics
- No blocking bugs
- Documentation updated
- Tests passing

## Initial Focus
For immediate implementation, focus should be on Phase 1 and early Phase 2, specifically:
1. Basic project structure with Three.js rendering
2. Simple input handling
3. Basic agent movement
4. Test environment for iteration

This will provide the foundation needed to experiment with movement mechanics and visual style, which will inform later development decisions.
